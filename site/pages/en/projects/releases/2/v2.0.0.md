# termux-exec-package v2.0.0 - 2024-12-16

## Changelog


**Commit history:** [`v1.0...v2.0.0`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/compare/v1.0...v2.0.0)

&nbsp;



// FIXME: Fix commits
// FIXME: The docs under `site/pages/en/projects/docs` use commit hashes to reference older commits in which a referred code was changed like for environment variables. If pull is rebased, then they would need to be updated. Moreover, pull needs to be merged locally with `git merge --ff-only pull-branch` instead of GitHub UI as that changes the hashes. This will be required for all site docs in all repositories.

### Added

- Add support to execute ELF files by passing them to `/system/bin/linker*` to bypass android app data file exec restriction if using `targetSdkVersion` `>= 28` on Android `>= 10`. Check [technical](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/blob/master/site/pages/en/projects/docs/technical/index.md) and [system linker exec](https://github.com/agnostic-apollo/Android-Docs/blob/master/site/pages/en/projects/docs/apps/processes/app-data-file-execute-restrictions.md#system-linker-exec) docs for info on how `system_linker_exec` works and why it is needed. ([`f261b26d`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/f261b26d))
- Since when executing with linker, the `/proc/self/exe` will be set to linker path, export `TERMUX_EXEC__PROC_SELF_EXE` environment variable with actual path to executable being executed so that packages can be patched to read it instead. Additional hocking will need to be done for programs that read `/proc/<pid>/exe`. ([`f261b26d`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/f261b26d))
- Hook the entire `exec()` family of functions, which is required for Android `14`. Closes termux/termux-packages#18537, termux/termux-app#3758 ([`f261b26d`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/f261b26d))

- Added the `bool` environment variable `TERMUX_EXEC__INTERCEPT_EXECVE` for whether `execve` would be hooked for shebang fix or `system_linker_exec`. The default value is `true`. The other wrapper functions in the `exec()` family of functions declared in `unistd.h` are always intercepted to solve some other issues on older Android versions, check [`libc/bionic/exec.cpp`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-14.0.0_r1:bionic/libc/bionic/exec.cpp) git history. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- Added the `string` `TERMUX_EXEC__SYSTEM_LINKER_EXEC` environment variable for whether to use `system_linker_exec` if `TERMUX_EXEC__INTERCEPT_EXECVE` is enabled. If set to `disable`, `system_linker_exec` will be disabled. If set to `enable`, then `system_linker_exec` will be enabled but only if required. If set to `force`, then `system_linker_exec` will be force enabled even if not required and is supported. The default value is `enable`. Check `should_system_linker_exec()` in `exec.h` and `exec.h` for more info and how its handled. Docs will be added in a later commit. The `system_linker_exec` will now engage for executable or interpreter paths that are under `TERMUX_APP__DATA_DIR` or `TERMUX_APP__LEGACY_DATA_DIR` instead of `TERMUX__ROOTFS` (`TERMUX_BASE_DIR`). ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- Read `ANDROID__BUILD_VERSION_SDK` environment variable exported by Termux app to get Android build version sdk, and if its not set, then from the `android_get_device_api_level()` call provided by `<android/api-level.h>`, which gets it from the system properties, which should be slower.

- Added logger framework with multiple log levels with log entries for all the important variable states to track logic. The singular `TERMUX_EXEC_DEBUG` environment variable has been removed. The `int` `TERMUX_EXEC__LOG_LEVEL` environment variable controls the log level based on `(OFF=0, NORMAL=1, DEBUG=2, VERBOSE=3, VVERBOSE=4 and VVVERBOSE=5)`. The default value is `1`. Normally, `termux-exec` does not log anything at default log level `1` (`NORMAL`) for hooks even and will require setting log level to `>= 2` (`DEBUG`) to see log messages. To enable `VVERBOSE` logging for a command, you can run something like `TERMUX_EXEC__LOG_LEVEL=4 id -u`. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- Added `TERMUX_EXEC_PKG__VERSION` `Makefile` parameter that gets logged on hook for `termux-exec` package version currently installed. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- Added testing framework via `tests/termux-exec-tests.in` that calls `tests/unit-tests.c` to run unit tests, and `runtime-binary-tests.c` and `tests/runtime-script-tests.in` for runtime tests. Old tests files in random places have been removed. The testing is done for `termux-exec` and other termux internal packages including `termux-core`, `termux-tools`, `termux-am`, `termux-api`, `tudo` and `sudo` to ensure a fully working termux environment. The entire `exec()` family of functions is also tested by `runtime-binary-tests.c`.  Currently, `termux-api` will not work in secondary users due to abstact namespace sockets being used. In future, tests can be moved to each package's own repo and a separate "tests caller" package can be added that runs tests for all packages that are installed. Tests can be run with `TERMUX_EXEC__LOG_LEVEL=1 "${TERMUX__PREFIX:-$PREFIX}/libexec/installed-tests/termux-exec/termux-exec-tests -vv all"`. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))

### Changed

- Use `TERMUX__PREFIX` environment variable to generate Termux bin path to replace `/bin` and `/usr/bin` path in shebang of scripts instead of using hardcoded `TERMUX_BASE_DIR` build variable. If environment variable is not set or is invalid as per `TERMUX__ROOTFS_DIR_MAX_LEN`, then we use the default Termux prefix for which package was compiled for as long as its executable and readable to ensure termux-exec was not compiled for a different package. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- Increase buffer size for executable file shebang header from `256` to `340` defined by `FILE_HEADER__BUFFER_LEN` as per termux path limits, check comment in `exec.h` file and [Termux File Path Limits](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Termux-file-system-layout#file-path-limits) docs. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- Decrease max length of valid `TERMUX__ROOTFS` from `200` to `86` defined by `TERMUX__ROOTFS_DIR_MAX_LEN`, check `termux_files.h` file and [Termux File Path Limits](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Termux-file-system-layout#file-path-limits) docs. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- Move `termux-exec` Apache 2.0 license file content from `LICENSE` to `licenses/termux__termux-exec__Apache-2.0.md` file and use `debian/copyright` format in `LICENSE` file. ([`5b482253`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/5b482253))

### Fixed

- Fix relative paths for interpreter path by absolutizing it. Previously, only prefix was being replaced. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- Fix `argv[0]` for executing shell scripts where it should be set to the original interpreter set in the file as is instead of the `argv[0]` to `execve()` being hooked for the executable. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- Fix `fexecve()` where executable path would be `/proc/self/fd/<n>` and checking if its under Termux app data directory directory would give wrong results. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- Fix checking if executable is under Termux directories. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- Fix hardcoded `com.termux` values being used, all constants are replaced during building including the root scope of environment variables that are read and as per `TERMUX_ENV__S_ROOT` defined in `properties.sh` of `termux-pacakges` as `TERMUX_`. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- Fix issues where `errno` may already be set when `execve` is entered, check comment in `init()` function of `termux-exec.c` where it is set to `0`. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- The `termux-exec-package.json` will now have correct version and be consistent with `build.sh`, and also include tests files, which wasn't being done before. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))
- The `termux-exec-package.json` previously had hardcoded `aarch64` as architecture, now we find and replace it for the compiler based on which predefined architecture macro is defined. ([`3fbc5a5f`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/commit/3fbc5a5f))

### Removed

- Removed the singular `TERMUX_EXEC_OPTOUT` environment variable. Opt outs should be confined to specific hooks and logics.
- The singular `TERMUX_EXEC_DEBUG` environment variable has been removed.

## Notes

- Usage docs are available [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/blob/master/site/pages/en/projects/docs/usage/index.md). You can run commands with `TERMUX_EXEC__LOG_LEVEL=4 id -u` after installing package for debugging. To run on normal termux with `targetSdkVersion` `<= 28`, run `TERMUX_EXEC__SYSTEM_LINKER_EXEC=force TERMUX_EXEC__LOG_LEVEL=4 id -u` instead. **Check [`TERMUX_EXEC__LOG_LEVEL`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/blob/master/site/pages/en/projects/docs/usage/index.md#termux_exec__log_level), [`TERMUX_EXEC__INTERCEPT_EXECVE`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/blob/master/site/pages/en/projects/docs/usage/index.md#termux_exec__intercept_execve), [`TERMUX_EXEC__SYSTEM_LINKER_EXEC`](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/blob/master/site/pages/en/projects/docs/usage/index.md#termux_exec__system_linker_exec) variable docs for more info on how to control behaviour of `termux-exec`.**
- Testing docs are available [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/blob/master/site/pages/en/projects/docs/developer/test/index.md). Run tests with `TERMUX_EXEC__LOG_LEVEL=1 TERMUX_API_APP__APP_VERSION_NAME=0.50.1 TERMUX_ROOTFS__PACKAGE_MANAGER=apt "${TERMUX__PREFIX:-$PREFIX}/libexec/installed-tests/termux-exec/termux-exec-tests" -vv all`. Exporting `TERMUX_API_APP__APP_VERSION_NAME` and `TERMUX_ROOTFS__PACKAGE_MANAGER` variables is necessary for running tests on older Termux app versions without scoped environment variable changes for package manager and Termux:API app tests to run.
- Build docs are available [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-exec/blob/master/site/pages/en/projects/docs/developer/build/index.md).
